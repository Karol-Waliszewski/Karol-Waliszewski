# Hi there, Karol Waliszewski here ðŸ‘‹

## About me ðŸ˜„
My name is Karol Waliszewski. I am a student of the WrocÅ‚aw University of Technology with a passion for programming and street training. Since I had access to games, I preferred to edit them than play them, but my adventure with programming began at the beginning of high school. I was learning C++ at first, but after ome time I tried Web Development and that was it! 

I am currently working as Web Developer and create many advanced web applications at my job. If I have some time I also work on my personal side projects, which you can check on my GitHub :)
